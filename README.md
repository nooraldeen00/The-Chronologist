Collaborated with a team of five to develop The Chronologist, it reflects a strong blend of innovative game design, mobile development, and coding. The project currently includes a fully functional main menu with level selection, with future iterations focusing on expanding levels, refining mechanics, and enhancing player immersion.
# 🎮 About the Project
Chronologist – Project Description

Chronologist is an Android platformer game, built using Android Studio, that combines time-travel mechanics with gravity manipulation to create a unique puzzle-solving and exploration experience. Players step into the role of a character who can bend time and alter gravity to navigate challenging levels, overcome obstacles, and solve intricate puzzles.

The game emphasizes logic, strategy, and creativity, requiring players to think beyond traditional platforming. Each level is designed to challenge problem-solving skills while maintaining engaging gameplay and smooth progression.

This project demonstrates a strong foundation in:

- 📱 Mobile app development with Android Studio

- 🕹️ Game design & mechanics (physics, gravity, puzzle logic)

- 🧩 Software engineering principles (modularity, scalability, Agile iteration)

- 🧪 Testing & debugging using JUnit and Android instrumentation

# 🚀 Key Features
- 🕰️ Time-travel gameplay: rewind & fast-forward game states

- 🌌 Gravity manipulation: flip physics to access hidden paths

- 🎮 Engaging platformer challenges: logic puzzles + action elements

- 📜 Main menu with level selection

- 🎨 Immersive design with future expansion for multiple worlds

- 📱 Runs on Android devices and emulators
